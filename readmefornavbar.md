Key CSS Changes Explained:

max-width: 90vw;: Prevents the navbar from touching the edges on small screens.

overflow-x: auto;: This is the magic property. It tells the container to allow horizontal scrolling if the content inside (the ul) is wider than the container itself.

::-webkit-scrollbar, -ms-overflow-style, scrollbar-width: These rules hide the ugly default scrollbar, making the scrolling behavior look clean and modern.

white-space: nowrap;: Ensures that your navigation links like "How It Works" don't break into two lines.
